#Directory for generating the BAM files for the RABT assembly (new geneset generated by cufflinks adding
#possible genes from the BAM files not detected on the official geneset.
#Because the trimmed fastq files were unbalanced due to tile filtering (R1 files had not the same
#number of reads than R2), the reads had to be split into different fastq files:
#- fastq files with all paired reads for both R1 and R2
#- fastq files with orphan reads from R1
#- fastq files with orphan reads from R2
#The splitting was performed using split_reads.sh
#Once the splitting was completed, several STAR jobes (two per type of fastq file) were ran using STAR_script.sh
#Once the bam files were generated, they were merged using merge_bam.sh.
#The resulting bam files were then fed into
